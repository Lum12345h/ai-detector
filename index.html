    =========================================================================
    AI Text Detector - Heuristic Analysis Demo
    Version: 1.0
    Author: Generated Example Code
    Date: 2023-10-27

    Purpose: Provides a user interface for analyzing text based on a large set
             of pre-defined linguistic rules and heuristics. Attempts to
             differentiate between common patterns found in some AI-generated
             text versus typical human writing.

    Disclaimer: This tool uses client-side JavaScript analysis based on
                heuristics. It is NOT a definitive or perfectly accurate AI
                detector. Sophisticated AI can mimic human writing well, and
                human writing can sometimes trigger flags. Results should be
                interpreted with caution. True detection requires more advanced
                server-side models.

                    <p>This tool analyzes text for patterns based on linguistic research and observations about typical AI outputs. However, AI is constantly evolving.</p>
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <li><strong>High AI Score:</strong> Suggests the text exhibits multiple patterns often found in AI writing (e.g., high uniformity, specific word choices, lower 'burstiness'). This does NOT guarantee it's AI. Complex human writing on technical topics might score higher.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low AI Score (High Human Score):</strong> Suggests the text aligns more with typical human writing patterns (e.g., varied sentence structure, richer vocabulary variance, personal touches). This does NOT guarantee it's human. Some AI can produce very human-like text.</li>
                        <li><strong>Burstiness:</strong> Refers to the variation in sentence length. Human writing tends to have higher burstiness (mix of long and short sentences). Some AIs produce more uniform lengths.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perplexity (Simulated):</strong> A measure of text predictability. Lower perplexity (more predictable) can sometimes indicate AI, but this tool uses a very simplified version.</li>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Q1: Is this detector 100% accurate?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> As stated multiple times, this is an experimental tool based on heuristics run in your browser. It cannot achieve the accuracy of sophisticated server-based AI models. Treat results with caution.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Q2: Why can't JavaScript detect AI perfectly?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Real AI detection requires immense computational power, access to massive datasets of human and AI text, and complex comparison models (often related to the AI models themselves). Browsers lack the resources and direct access needed for this level of analysis.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Q3: What are 'heuristics'?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Heuristics are rules of thumb or educated guesses used for problem-solving when an exact solution is impractical or impossible. In this context, they are linguistic patterns (like sentence length variation, word choice frequency) that statistically *tend* to differ between human and some AI writing, but are not foolproof indicators.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Q4: My human-written text was flagged as AI! Why?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">This can happen. Formal writing, technical documents, or text that happens to be very uniform in structure might trigger some heuristics. It highlights the limitations of a purely rule-based approach.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Q5: An AI text wasn't flagged! Why?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Modern AI models are incredibly advanced and are constantly being improved to generate text that is indistinguishable from human writing, specifically designed to bypass simple rule-based checks.</p>
            </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q6: What text length works best?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">Longer texts (several paragraphs, ideally 300+ words) provide more data for the heuristics to work with. Very short texts are difficult to analyze reliably using these methods.</p>
             </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q7: Is my text sent anywhere?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">No. All analysis is performed directly within your web browser using JavaScript. Your text is not uploaded to any server by *this* specific script.</p>
             </details>
              <!-- Add more FAQs as needed to reach line count -->
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q8: What is 'Burstiness'?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">It refers to the variation in sentence lengths within a text. Human writing often exhibits higher 'burstiness', meaning a mix of short and long sentences, while some AI models might produce text with more uniform sentence lengths. This tool measures this variation.</p>
             </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q9: What is 'Perplexity' (in this tool)?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">True perplexity is a complex measure from information theory about how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity means the text is less surprising (more predictable). This tool uses a *highly simplified proxy* based on word frequencies, not a true perplexity calculation, which would require a language model.</p>
             </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q10: Can this detect specific AI models (GPT-3, GPT-4)?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">No. This tool uses general heuristics. It cannot differentiate between specific AI models. Model-specific detection requires techniques tailored to the architecture and training data of those models, usually done server-side.</p>
             </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q11: Are the 'scores' scientifically validated?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">No. The scores and weights assigned to different heuristics are experimental and based on general observations. They lack rigorous scientific validation and calibration against large, diverse datasets.</p>
             </details>
             <details class="faq-item">
                 <summary class="faq-question">Q12: Why so many lines of code if it's not perfect?</summary>
                 <p class="faq-answer">The large codebase implements numerous individual heuristic checks. While each rule alone is weak, combining many provides a *slightly* more nuanced (though still limited) picture than a very simple check. The size reflects the complexity of *attempting* this via rules, not necessarily the accuracy.</p>
